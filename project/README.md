I built this website to serve as a simple informational hub for the Philosophy Graduate Student Association at Saint Louis University.

Here is the youtube link: https://youtu.be/1R7ewM6Kx1w

I am presently a graduate
student in philosophy at SLU. The site is controlled by a simple application.py file, contains about 10 HTML files, and uses CSS to improve user
experience. Here is a run-down of the purpose and functionity of each HTML file.

1. layout.html
Gives the layout of each page, with a nav-bar at top, a footer at bottom, and leaves the main section to be filled in.

2. index.html
The site's about page; includes a short paragraph of what the PGSA is for and a link to the SLU department webspage.

3. conference.html
The site's page on SLU's annual graduate student philosophy conference. Includes an embedded webpage of our recent Call-For-Papers from another site called PhilEvents,
an embedded youtube playlist of past conferences, and a list of the names of past conferences.

4. calendar.html
Embeds a Google calendar which holds all of our past and upcoming events.

5. resources.html
Includes a list of links to useful documents and websites. It also contains a form with a password input. Successfully entering the password renders
teachingresources.html which hosts sensitve documents that only the PGSA members should see (e.g., course syllabi, copywrited book chapters and articles). Failure
renders invalid.html which contains an apology to the user for entering the wrong password.

6. studentwebsites.html
Contains a list of links to the websites of our graduate students.

7. photoalbum.html
Contains a collection of photos.

8. contact.html
Contains contact information and a link to our facebook page.
